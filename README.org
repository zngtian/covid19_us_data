This repository maintains the dataset of the COVID-19 in
U.S. counties. The original database is "the 2019 Novel Coronavirus
COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository" by Johns Hopkins CSSE
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 

Each daily update is saved in a csv file named
"uscases_YYYY-MM-DD". The file =20200320_pa_closing_naics.csv=
contains the list of industries that are classified as either
life-sustaining or not, according the Governor Wolf's order on March
19, 2020. 

A sample code to read all daily data is given below.
#+begin_src R
read_uscases_alltime <- function(start_date, end_date) {
    ## start_data and end_date are characters in the form of YYYY-MM-DD.
    ## This function requires the R packages of lubridate and tidyverse.

    d1 <- ymd(start_date)
    d2 <- ymd(end_date)

    d <- d1
    fnames <- vector(mode = "character")
    while (d <= d2) {
        f <- str_c("uscases_", d, ".csv")
        fnames <- c(fnames, f)
        d <- d + 1
    }

    fpaths <- map_chr(fnames, ~ file.path(.))

    dat <- map_dfr(fpaths, ~ read_csv(.))
}
#+end_src
