This repository maintains the dataset of the COVID-19 in U.S. counties
and other related data that are used to write NERCRD briefs on
COVID-19. All data are saved under the =data= folder. 

Currently (up to [2020-04-09 Thu]), the data files are as follows

- =uscases_cty.csv=. This file contains the COVID-19 data from the New
  York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). The dataset
  has two geographic exceptions that need manual correction: (1) New
  York City include all cases of five counties but does not have an
  FIPS. I assign it with the FIPS of New York County, "36061". (2)
  Kansas City excludes cases of four counties that the city is
  seated. This gives rise to some difficulty in combining with other
  county-level data sources, such as American Community Survey, which
  does not have city data but county ones. I combine all city and
  county data into one geographic unit as Kansas City and give it an
  FIPS "29901". However, the dataset does not include cases with
  unknown location in each state. 

- =uscases_unknown.csv=. This file contains the cases with unknown
  location for all states. 

- =pop_density.csv=. This file contains the data on total population,
  population of age 60+, population density, etc., extracted from the
  2014-2018 American Community Survey. The data for New York City and
  Kansas City are combined with data of the cities and their seating
  counties.

- =rucc_region.csv=. This file contains the Rural-Urban Continuum Code
  of the USDA and the division of Census Regions. The counties in New
  York City and Kansas City are removed. The two cities are assigned
  ~RUCC: 1~.

- =pa_closing_naics=. This file contains the list of essential
  life-sustaining sectors that are operating under the stay-at-home
  order of Pennsylvania Governor Wolf. 

- =spatial_uscty_agg.rds=. This R data file contains the spatial data
  from U.S. counties. The original data is contained in the R package
  ~albersusa~ that shifts the geo-locations of Alaska and Hawaii
  immediately below the continental states. The rows for the counties
  in New York City and Kansas City are combined into the cities.

- =jhm=. The folder contains the files of cases of COVID-19 of US
  counties, extracted from "the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19
  (2019-nCoV) Data Repository" by Johns Hopkins CSSE
  (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Each daily update is
  saved in a csv file named =uscases_YYYY-MM-DD.csv=.
